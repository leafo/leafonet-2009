# Leafo.net 2009

This is a version of leafo.net from 2009. It was named "Leafo.net beta". It's a
straight forward message board. Has a brand new design from all the other
message boards I released. No other special functionality.

This one is still running as well, but I've got it hidden.

Unlike leafo.net 2005, this version correctly escapes queries against injection
tags. Templating is done with a custom built template compiler that I probably
built around the same time as this site.
